NewGen IEDC aims to inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the young S&T students, encourage and support start-up creation through guidance, mentorship & support. NewGen IEDCs would be established in academic institutions where students will be encouraged to take up innovative projects with possibility of commercialization.\nNewGen IEDCs would also spread the message of entrepreneurship and create a culture of entrepreneurship in the Host Institution (HI). With faculty already trained in the nuances of entrepreneurship, the presence of IEDCs in HI would create a vibrant entrepreneurial culture amongst the students. Few amongst the “Job-Seekers” would be converted to “JobGenerators” through the entrepreneurial route.\nAbout Sphoorthy IEDC\nSphoorthy Engineering College firmly believes in Innovation as the key to ignite novel ideas and critical thinking in young engineers, to address various complex engineering and societal challenges. In the year 2017, It is the only college in Telangana got a grant for the establishment of New Generation Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NewGen IEDC) approved by Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the aegis of National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB) and Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII). The NewGen IEDC ensures each innovative student idea gets a prototype fund of Rs. 2,50,000 and a total of 2.3 crore for 85 Student projects.\nSalient features of IEDC:\nIt is a five-year programme to be implemented in an educational institution\nA maximum of twenty new projects per Institution would be supported in a year\nThe projects should be students’ projects with a high degree of innovation and commercial viability to lead to possible start-up by students\nAs far as possible, the projects should be multi-disciplinary in nature and to be executed by teams consisting of students drawn from various levels.\nFunctions of IEDC:\nTo motivate, support and mentor students for identification, development, and commercialization of their innovative ideas\nTo initiate targeted number of innovative student projects each year for new product development\nTo organize Business Plan Competitions/Innovation Camps/ Hackathons with active involvement of industry and alumni\nTo guide and assist prospective entrepreneurs on various aspects such as preparing project reports, obtaining project approvals, loans and facilities from agencies of support system, technologies information, etc.\nTo arrange interaction with entrepreneurs, bankers, professionals, potential customers and create a mentorship scheme for student innovators\nTo facilitate creation of entrepreneur’s club / E-Cells in the college to foster culture of entrepreneurship amongst students\nActivities Performed During the years:\nWorkshop on Idea Generation and Innovation\nEntrepreneurship Awareness Camp (EAC)\nEntrepreneurship Awareness Program by Sphoorthy NewGen IEDC\nWorkshop on Design Thinking\nWorkshop on Patents\nSmart India Hackathon Participation\nWorkshop on Business Plan\nWorkshop on Team Building Essentials\nWorkshop on Leadership & Management\nIDEATHON- Innovative Idea competition\nStudents participation in Chinna Shodana Yatra in Assocation with Palle Srujana\nAwareness program by NEN Mentors to the Students.\nProject Expo By Sphoorthy Engineering College Students\nTraining programs on Advanced technologies (IOT, DRONES, ROBOTICS, ANDROID ,3D PRINTING\nInnovation Expo organized by Sphoorthy NewGen IEDC in association with Palle Srujana\nstudent’s participation in “Entrepreneurship Development Program for Student Entrepreneurs” by NAARM\nFacilities Available:\nRobotic Lab.\nFab Lab with Mechanical and Electrical Components.\nExpert Mentors in each emerging technology domain.\nR & D Engineers to support student innovations.\nExternal Industry Association to guide student Innovations.\nIndustrial grid 3D Printer.\nCo2 based Laser Cutting Facility.\nAdvanced Wi-Fi Hotspot setup for students to work on IoT related projects.\nReach Us for More information\nSharath Vedala\nChief Coordinator NewGen IEDC\n9652109999\nhead.ce@sphoorthyengg.ac.in, vsharath@sphoorthyengg.ac.in\nGallery\nDownload Brochure\nFull Name\nEmail Id\nMobile\nSubmit\nDownload Brochure\nDownload Brochure",
